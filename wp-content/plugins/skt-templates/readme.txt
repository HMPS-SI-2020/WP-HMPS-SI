== FAQs ==

= Will the SKT Templates plugin work with my theme? =

Of course it will work with any WordPress theme provided it does not conflicts with Elementor plugin.

All the themes displayed in our plugin backend are free of cost. In the initial release we are launching 60 designs. However we will soon to updating the list to over 100+ within a month's time.

= Can i import in an existing website? =

Yes you can however its recommended to use it in a fresh or blank WordPress installation because if your existing website has plugins or your existing website theme conflicts with Elementor you might land up in trouble. So either take a backup of your existing site before doing so or else install in a fresh/blank WordPress website to test it.

= Can i deactivate the plugin afterwards? =

Yes if your site import is done and you are currently editing via Elementor or if you have already set up the site you can deactivate the plugin.
